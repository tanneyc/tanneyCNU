# The Grand Tour of Italy Project Review 

As digital humanities projects are growing in today’s day and age, a lot of projects and sites aim to create an interactive platform for users to grasp material more effectively. 

Have you ever wished that you could live through a different time? Ever wondered what It’d be like to be a traveler during the eighteenth-century? The Grand Tour Project allows you to envision the journeys, through visualizations and gives you an opportunity to place yourself in these traveler’s shoes. 

The Grand Tour Project is a digital humanities project that’s major purpose is to inform readers of what is known as “The Grand Tour of Italy” and how it shaped Europeans within the eighteenth century. The Grand Tour constituted modernity and many other aspects like culture and art, which improved the lifestyle during this time. This project encompasses its achievements by giving readers more insight of the journeys and discoveries within this period in a more “visual” and “interactive” way. 

The site is overall easy to navigate for first time visitors. There are clickable links bolded at the top so it’s not hard to miss. Red being the dominant color for most of the site allows for more to stand out and be noticed. Along with that, everything is labeled so you can click on what information you specifically want to see. (insert image). 

The project also does a good job with providing previous events that have occurred from past years. This helps with the credibility of previous workshops proving that they have been done before and have been successful in the past. It’s a way to ensure the viewers that this is something that new viewers can take part in during the future. It is a growing project that may or not be offering more event workshops to any further interested participants. Alongside of that, the project offers “news” and several pages of “project updates” that keep those who are intrigued to stay involved and absorb new information of what else is being done. 

“The Grand Tour Explorer” is an ongoing application that captures a historian’s dictionary entries that have been turned into research evidence on the life lived back then. The application incorporates an interactive page that takes you to graphs of the stats and data taken from that research, where viewers can interact by maneuvering around and see it all in a more organized way. Viewers have more leisure when it comes to interacting with the graphs because they can play around with it and essentially explore as if they are also an explorer during this time.

While the project aims to portray the aura of the eighteenth century, it does lack creativity and overall appeal to the site. More could be implemented to make it more engaging and visually appealing for viewers to fully picture, The Grand Tour.
