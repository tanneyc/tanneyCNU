# About Me Blog

Hi! My name is Tanney and I am a junior at Christopher Newport University! 

Going into college, I was undecided for quite a while, so it’s relieving to finally know what I want to pursue. I knew I wanted to do something that involved understanding other people and seeing why and how they are the way that they are. With that being said, I majored in ***communication***! As for my minor, the digital world is always evolving so I thought the two would go hand-in-hand. That’s pretty much why I am in this course, I want to know more and expand my knowledge on something that will continue to be a part in everyone’s day-to-day lives.

Besides that, let's knock out some of the basic background about myself. I have lived in Richmond, Virginia my whole life, but if you want to get down to the specifics, I live in the Glen Allen/Henrico. I have 2 siblings, a brother and a sister, and unfortunately I am the oldest. It's a lot of pressure but sometimes it's nice being feeling like a leader. Over the summer I got to work at my mom's doctor's office and it was really cool seeing the behind the scenes of the medical field. I loved being able to talk to patients and be a friendly face for them in an environment like that. I don't have any pets, which definitely makes my life a little more boring, but we do have a stray cat that always comes to hangout on my back porch at home. We gave him a name, Oliver, and we love tending to him by feeding him and checking up on him whenever he's out there. He's the sweetest and is the closest thing I'll ever get to having a real pet.

Growing up, I tried to explore a lot when it came to hobbies. I played soccer and piano for most of my life, and while those didn't last, I was glad I was able to have something that I enjoyed doing for a while. Once school picked up and life got busier, it was harder to find more passions, so I stuck with simpler things. Other than hanging out with my friends in my free time, I love doing what most people do, which is listening to music. I use music as my escape almost always and it became something that I needed to be doing at all times. Some of my favorite artists: 

* The Neighbourhood  

* Tyler, The Creator 

* Taylor Swift 

Don't ask me who my top artist on Spotify was though. Definitely not Olivia Rodrigo.

Alongside of that, I love going to concerts and being able to hear the music I loved from my headphones to live right in front of me. I also picked up on reading and writing which both have been more escapes for me. Speaking of writing, I've always wanted to start a blog and express myself through writing because I felt like I've always had more to say when I wrote than what I could ever say out loud. Although, contrary to that, I've even wanted to start expressing myself through vlogs and became passionate about creating content through videos and editing them in ways that showed off my personality. I find that expressing yourself through media is such an art in itself. 

I am a big Marvel and Harry Potter fan, hufflepuffs represent :joy: I love the show *Survivor*, even though I've only seen 2 seasons, and my happy place is the beach, making sharks my favorite animal. 

I hope that this blog allowed you get to know more about me and what my interests are and I'm sure most of you all can relate, but I think it's so cool how these things can connect as as humans and I am hoping that we can do the same in the classroom as well!
