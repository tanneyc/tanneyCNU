# First Time Oxygen Experience 

## TEI Project 
I was assigned the preface for “Dracula’s Guest” by Bram Stoker. “Dracula’s Guest” is a short story about an Englishman who goes on a journey on what happens to be Walpurgis Night and ends up having an encounter with Dracula. The story is suspenseful and contains an eeriness that keeps readers on their toes.

For this project, our main goal was to code our section of the story using TEI, which stands for *Text Encoding Initiative*. We had to use the program, Oxygen which allowed us to code in XML which is short for *extensible markup language*. Everyone in the class was assigned a section from “Dracula’s Guest” and were responsible for marking the passage of things like em-dashes or quotes within a Google doc. This process was meant to make our experience in Oxygen a lot easier for ourselves because we would have already identified the different features beforehand.

After completing that, our next step was to insert everything into Oxygen. We used separate computers that the school provided because the program was already downloaded onto them. This saves a lot of time and space for us. We created a new file and had to code using specific tags we marked in our passage just through simple copy and paste. It was a lot easier than I expected, especially without any previous experience with the program. Our entire passage had to be inside of the body and we just had to make sure we placed the tags in the right places. 

Our professor, Dr. Stover provided us with the tags we needed which was really helpful when doing it. On top of that, having the preface of the story meant I was the only one who had a **byline** which was essentially who the story was told by. Oxygen also includes a little box in the right hand corner of your document and turns either red or green to indicate your status and success. It turns green if there are no errors in your code, but turns red if you made a mistake somewhere. That feature is very useful to catch any small errors you may have missed, especially since coding is so tedious.

## Overall Takeaway

As a first time Oxygen and XML user, it all seemed very intimidating to understand at first. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to learn everything in such quick manner, especially because coding is like a completely new language to me. I have coded in the past, but with HTML which was easy to figure out after some practice. I was hoping that it would be the same with XML, but it took me a while to fully feel comfortable with it in a new program I have never seen or heard of before. While it was all new to me, it was very cool to have first-hand experience of my own and learn the basics of coding. I feel very lucky and fortunate to have access to the tools to even practice with coding because not a lot of people have the opportunity to be a part of what will eventually become an even bigger part of our future.
